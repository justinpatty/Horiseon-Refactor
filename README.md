# Horiseon-Refactor
Updating Horiseons html and css files to be more clear and less repetitive 
I took the original code and altered it to be more efficient and better accessible for all users. I removed and replaced some code for optimization. I restructured some parts so that the program would flow better without compromising the site's overall functionality.
